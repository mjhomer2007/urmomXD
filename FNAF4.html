    <h2> Gameplay </h2>
    <p> This is the fourth game of the series and first in the story. The base gameplay is based in a house where the player has to check 2 doors on each side of the room, a closet at the front end of the room, and a bed behind the player. You have to keep the enemies from killing you untill 6AM where the night ends. The main enemies in the game are Nightmare Bonnie, Nightmare Freddy, Nightmare Chica, and Nightmare Foxy. Nightmare Bonnie and Chica rome the left and right hallway respectively. You can flash the hallway to see if the enemy is in the hallway, but if their at the door they will kill you. Before shining your light you can listen for breathing that signifies that the character is at the door. If you hear breathing you can shut the door and keep it closed until the breathing stops and they go away. Nightmare Freddy has minions called Freddles. These freddles will appear on your bed one by one. Shining your light on the freddles will make them flee from the bed. If you don't shine your light in time freddy will kill you. The last one is Nightmare Foxy. you will see him at either hallway and you can shine your light to deter him. After a little bit he will move to your closet where he will appear at the closet door. If he is their you can close the closet door and push him back into the closet. After night 5 these four animatronics will keep attacking you until 4AM. After then either Nightmare Fredbear or Nightmare will replace all the animatronics. They will appear in all the spots that the normal animatronics appear in one at a time and is very agressive. After each night you play an 8bit minigame which hints about the lore that this game brings to the story.</p>
